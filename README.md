# Useful.String.Extensions
A .Net Core class library collection of extension methods for the "string" class in C#.

This repo uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][1]

<br/>

Introduction
------------
This is a collection of extension methods that I have been in need of many a time, so I finally wrote them in a nuget package and published the code here. They are designed to be "ease-of-life" and "generally making your life easier" methods.


<br/>

Installation
------------
To use the library, either download the package from NuGet by searching for "Useful.String.Extensions" or clone the repo and build in it "Release", which will create a package file in the project's release dir - `~\Useful.String.Extensions\Useful.String.Extensions\bin\Release`. Then you have to install the package file in your project.

Documentation

The methods in the package and project have ample summary information, you can also consult the [Wiki][2].
